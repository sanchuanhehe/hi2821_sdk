 * </ul>
 *
 * @param  initArrayStart  [IN] Start address of init_array section.
 * @param  initArrayEnd    [IN] End address of init_array section.
 * @param  flag            [IN] The flag indicating when LOS_CppSystemInit() is called,
 *                              #BEFORE_SCATTER, #AFTER_SCATTER or #NO_SCATTER.
 *
 * @retval #LOS_OK         Initialization succeeded.
 * @retval #LOS_NOK        The entered parameter is incorrect, initialization failed.
